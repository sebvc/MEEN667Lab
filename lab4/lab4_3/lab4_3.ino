/* Team: Sebastian Villa, Logan Morris, Alan Gregory
 * Assignment:
 * Write a program that can handle both types of interrupts you learned today 
 * (external using the pushbutton switch and internal timer using the Timer3 library). 
 *    • In the void loop() function, do nothing. 
 *    • When the timer interrupt is called, print “T”. 
 *    • When the the external interrupt is called, print “E”.
